# task1
in this task I designed a circuit controlled by Arduino.
The circuit contains five servo motors which all connected to the Ardunio to control its angle.
I used Tinkercad to design this task and here is the link of my work : https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0AcjyqJFB7X-bodacious-jaiks/editel?sharecode=3bdbgh16PDCo-4D3R8pJ1CrWFROdSgNaBBx5L5E7mHQ&sharecode=3bdbgh16PDCo-4D3R8pJ1CrWFROdSgNaBBx5L5E7mHQ
